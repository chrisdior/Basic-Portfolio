# Basic-Portfolio

Using basic HTML/CSS to design this portfolio. _(No mobile responsive applied to it yet.)_ 

### Reflection:
This basic portfolio helps me to understand the concepts of HTML and CSS better. I have experiment with different units of expressing sizes and length, such as,  `em`, `%`, and `px`, to learn more about their difference. I still need to go to do some research to get to know about these units more. 

I still need to do more practice in CSS in order to write code more semantic.
